# Programming Paradigms   
Class System for Programming Languages based on their features. Multi-Paradigm Languages do exist.   
Excerpt from Wikipedia :)   
  Some paradigms are concerned mainly with implications for the [execution model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Execution_model) of the language, such as allowing [side effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect_(computer_science)), or whether the sequence of operations is defined by the execution model. Other paradigms are concerned mainly with the way that code is organized, such as grouping a code into units along with the state that is modified by the code. Yet others are concerned mainly with the style of [syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_(programming_languages)) and [grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_grammar).   
   
> Imperative - You are given the recipe and knowledge to make the cake by yourself   

- [Procedural](https-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-procedural_programmi.md) - This is how Minecraft and No Man's Sky are Infinite.   
- [Object-oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) - A fruit has seeds, apple has seeds and is red and sweet, a tomato has seeds and is red and slimy. they inherit the properties of a fruit 
 then extend it with a colour and texture.   
   
> Declarative - The drill sargeant moves your body for you and yells in your ear   

- [Functional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) - molten aluminum → sheet cast → sheet roller x10 → tin foil   
- [Logical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_programming) - If all razzies are lazzies and all lazzies are bloops then all razzies are bloops.   
- [Reactive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_programming) - Put your thumb in front of the hose so it fans out for more lawn coverage. Pour food colouring down the hose to change water colour without affecting water flow properties.   
   
> Symbolic - Java disassociated and started to pick apart the thing below it to find out that it was picking itself apart. Not agreed upon to actually exist as a paradigm.   

- Reflection and similar metaprogramming techniques — Advanced topic   
- Homoiconic languages like Wolfram, Lisp, Prolog and Julia — No one cares.
